Experimental EMGD DDX driver.

This is an experimental X server driver that uses KMS/GEM to interface
with the kernel mode driver.  

It provides the framework for embedded feature support but currently 
only supports basic driver functions.


Differences from the production EMGD DDX driver:

1) Implements the new xf86 driver interfaces (XRandR 1.3+ support)
2) Uses GEM/Intel buffer manager for buffer management
3) Re-worked EMGD Escape API to remove most API's 
4) No dependency on existing EMGD custom DRM IOCTL's
5) No XRender acceleration (UXA is used for buffer management only)
6) No support for EMGD config options. The options are parsed, but not used.


Right now, this works (but is buggy) with the OTC kernel DRM code. It can be
used to test/debug the EMGD KMS/GEM code.


DRI2 is implemented and does work, but it requires a emgd_dri.so file. On
my system I symlinked the i965_dri.so file to emgd_dri.so and this seems
to work.  We'll probably need to change our dri2 code to look for OTC dri
libraries.
